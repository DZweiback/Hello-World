# Hello-World
This is my introductory and test repository.  From time to time I will post information about my experiences here.
According to the instructions/tutorial, I am suppose to write a bit about myself here. The next step says to write a commit message that describes my changes.
I purposely typed the last sentence as a long sentance/paragrah. I wanted to see how this editing file handles long text. I see that it wraps the text around, rather than putting it on a new line.
Next, I will click the Commit changes button.
